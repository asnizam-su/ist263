            I’m currently majoring in Information Management & Technology with a concentration in Information Security. I also have minors in Chinese Languages & Computer Science. I’m interested in working abroad in the cybersecurity and risk management fields.
            -	Experience in Python
            -	U100 Campus Tour Guide
            -	Sound Director for the First Year Players
            -	Vice-President of Delta Chi Syracuse Chapter
            Come rain or shine you can find me on the soccer pitch. I just started training for the Syracuse half-marathon. I also love to gather round a fire with my brothers or cook up a storm in the kitchen. This is the beginning of a new journey with HTML/CSS and I’m excited to get to work in ist263.
