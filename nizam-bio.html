            Come rain or shine you can find me on the soccer pitch. I just started training for the Syracuse half-marathon. I also love to gather round a fire with my brothers or cook up a storm in the kitchen. This is the beginning of a new journey with HTML/CSS and I’m excited to get to work in ist263.
